<h1>Gender Inequality </h1>
  <h2> What is gender inequality?</h2>  
<p>Gender inequality is described as a phenomenon where there is an unequal treatment based on gender. </p>
<h2>How does it start?</h2>
<p>Gender inequality starts in childhood. Whereas, in some countries, boys are encouraged to go to school while girls are to learn household responsibilities.
Additionally, many girls in schools receive less encouragement than boys to pursue their academic interests. There are several causes for this, including Girls' demands for cleanliness, hygiene, and safety may go unmet, which prevents them from attending class on a regular basis. Gender differences in learning and skill development result from discriminatory teaching methods and educational resources. As a result, compared to 1 in 10 boys, roughly 1 in 4 girls between the ages of 15 and 19 are neither employed nor enrolled in an educational program.</p>
<h2>How can we help?</h2> 
<p> Half of the world's population, and hence half of its potential, are women and girls. However, gender inequality is still a problem today and is holding back social advancement. You can help by donating to organizations that focus on promoting human rights for women and girls linked below
